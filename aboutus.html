    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are team Certified Couch Potatoes!</p>
    <p>For our Hunter College CodeFest 2021 submission, we decided to create a game that takes us back to beginning of the pandemic and explores choices and how it affects us. Making a decision is a balancing act of various factors in our busy lives. With the addition of Covid-19, this balance has been harder to maintain for many of us. In our game, we hope to take a step back and reflect our choices from a common perspective in a fun and educational way. Enjoy!</p>
